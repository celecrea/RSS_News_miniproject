But he argues triumph is not certain \u2013 we must not rest till the industry is forced to keep the carbon in the ground.<br></p><p>You can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/series/keep-it-in-the-ground\">read previous pieces here</a></p><p>The official view: all eyes are on <a href=\"http://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/en/french-foreign-policy-1/climate-7436/2015-paris-climate-conference/\">Paris</a>, where negotiators will meet in December for a climate conference that will be described as \u201cthe most important diplomatic gathering ever\u201d and \u201ca last chance for humanity.\u201d Heads of state will jet in, tense closed-door meetings will be held, newspapers will report that negotiations are near a breaking point, and at the last minute some kind of agreement will emerge, hailed as \u201ca start for serious action\u201d.<br /></p><p> The actual story: what happens at Paris will be, at best, one small part of the climate story, one more skirmish in the long, hard-fought road to climate sanity. What comes before and after will count more. And to the extent Paris matters, its success will depend not on the character of our leaders but on how much a resurgent climate movement has softened up the fossil fuel industry, and how much pressure the politicians feel to deliver something.</p> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/09/climate-fight-wont-wait-for-paris-vive-la-resistance\">Continue reading...</a>\n",

But the divestment campaign is not arguing for an end of all fossil fuel use starting tomorrow, with everyone heading back to caves to light a campfire. Instead it is arguing that the burning of fossil fuels at increasing rates is driving global warming, which is the actual threat to modern civilisation. Despite already having at least three times more proven reserves than the world\u2019s governments agree can be safely burned, <a href=\"http://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/DBR_INTERNET_EN-PROD/PROD0000000000349119.pdf#page=21\">fossil fuel companies are spending huge sums</a> exploring for more.
